But do it responsibly, and realize that failure is a very real possibility that you must plan for.]\n[Don\u0027t blame me for the decisions you make; they are ultimately your own.]\n[Now, on with the adventure.]\n[]\n[]\n[PREFACE]\n[Three years ago, I worked for a big company.]\n[I did everything a good American employee is supposed to do. I worked hard. I devoted all of my thoughts to making this big company even more successful. I commuted an hour each way, without complaint. I worked 50 hours every week at a minimum. And when I got home, I let them page me at 2 AM if something needed my attention � which happened pretty often.]\n[Over the years, I was rewarded with more responsibility, and more money � although it never seemed to be quite enough. I was considered a role-model software development manager, and I felt successful. ]\n[At home however, my marriage was under stress, my kids hardly knew me, and I was on prescription sleep aids in order to combat the extreme stress I was under. My family wasn\u0027t happy living in the part of the country we lived in, and they weren\u0027t happy with me. But, all that felt secondary to my duty to my employer, and my duty as a provider for my family. I was doing what I thought I had to do.]\n[Three years ago, I was faced with an ultimatum from my family � it was my job, or them.]\n[A few weeks later, I quit my job. I walked away from about a million dollars� worth of stock grants in doing so, and I wasn\u0027t happy about it. ]\n[But, I made the decision to try working for myself before seeking another traditional job.]\n[Today, I run my own software company out of my home. I have no employees to worry about, and a revenue stream that matches anything I ever made as a successful senior manager at a big tech company. I now live someplace with a lower cost of living, I don\u0027t eat out as much, and I have no commuting costs to deal with�  so I get to keep much more of that money.  My entire family is happy, and we\u0027re closer than we\u0027ve ever been.]\n[I don\u0027t worry about money anymore. I don\u0027t worry about my career growth, or about saying the wrong thing to some executive. I have no commute and no meetings. I don\u0027t have to be in the office at 9 AM, nor have any artificial requirement to work a set number of hours each day, or each week. I don\u0027t write or receive performance reviews. I never have to fire anyone. Nobody can fire me, and nobody can lay me off.]\n[I don\u0027t take sleep aids any longer, because my stress level is basically zero. I\u0027m 43 years old, and I\u0027m pretty sure this is what retirement is supposed to feel like �  except I\u0027m not too old to enjoy it, and I\u0027m not broke.]\n[I\u0027m not telling you this to gloat. I\u0027m telling you this because maybe you\u0027re like I was three years ago. Maybe some part of you knows that your only reward for your hard work is going to be a heart attack in a few years, but you feel trapped by your salary and your responsibilities. You\u0027ve accepted society\u0027s expectations of focusing entirely on your work until you\u0027re 65 or so, at which point you hope you\u0027ll have enough money saved to actually retire, and enough health left to enjoy it.]\n[I\u0027m here to tell you there is another path. Taking it isn\u0027t easy, but success means personal and financial freedom that you never knew was possible.]\n[This book tells you how I did it, while minimizing the risks to my family in the process. It shares what I\u0027ve learned along the way. You don\u0027t have to be rich to do this, and you don\u0027t need to be a software developer. But if you have the smarts and tenacity to be self-sufficient, read on � it may just save your life, in more ways than one.]\n[]\n[]\n[PART I: MAKING THE BIG DECISION]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[OVERCOMING INERTIA]\n[The first step toward self-employment is to want it.]\n[If you\u0027ve spent your entire professional life working for someone else, self-employment is a very scary proposition. The life you have is familiar and comfortable, and the easiest thing is to just continue along your current career path. Discarding that career and striking out on your own is a bold thing to do. Your psyche is going to rebel against a change of this magnitude, and find ways to justify not trying it.]\n[It\u0027s therefore not surprising that many self-employed individuals were forced into their situation. The ones that become successful on their own talk a lot about the personal freedom they enjoy as a result, but seeking personal freedom is not what motivated them to achieve it. According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report, 29% of freelancers fell into their self-employment by necessity, after being laid off or downsized.]\n[It\u0027s better to transition into self-employment on your own terms. If you start planning and set up your new business before you quit your day job, you can ensure you have income flowing from the first day you start working for yourself. This book will arm you with the details you need to make that happen, but first you need to decide if this is an effort worth taking.]\n[Before we talk about how to become self-employed, I want you to understand the forces working against you. I want you to come to terms with them, and I want you to understand the reasons why it is worth the effort to overcome them. That\u0027s what the first part of this book is about: understanding the barriers to self-employment, both real and imagined, and understanding why self-employment is still a goal worth pursuing. When we\u0027re done, we\u0027ll do a self-assessment to see if you\u0027re really in a position to take the leap into self-employment.]\n[FEAR OF FAILURE]\n[Your paycheck puts food on the table and a roof over your head pretty reliably. The idea of giving that up quickly brings up images of your family starving and your house getting foreclosed. This is a real risk, but with proper planning and educated decision making, it�s a risk you can minimize.]\n[If you have responsibilities at home, you should not quit your day job until:]\n[* You\u0027ve got a financial safety net in place, and hard and fast rules as to how low you\u0027re willing to let those reserves get before returning to the workplace]\n[* You have a plan for getting another job if you need it]\n[* You\u0027ve already prototyped your business on the side and proven it is viable]\n[So, you\u0027re going into this with an upper bound on what you\u0027re willing to lose before calling it quits. Worst case, you learned a few things along the way.]\n[But just how risky is entrepreneurship? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Small Business Administration (SBA), 50% of all new businesses survive at least five years. A third of new businesses survive ten years or more. Now, think about how long you expect your current job to last. Would you say there\u0027s more than a 50% chance your employer will still be around five years from now, and you\u0027ll still be working for that same company? The Bureau of Labor Statistics has that answer as well. The average job tenure in the US in 2012 was only 4.6 years. ]\n[Does starting your own business seem that risky now?]\n[Here\u0027s another statistic � the 2012 Freelance Industry Report shows that only 22% of freelancers feel less financially secure than when they were an employee. 28% \"strongly agree\" they are better off financially working for themselves, and 29% \"moderately agree.\" Freelancers don\u0027t represent all of the self-employed, but it\u0027s always an option for you.]\n[22 million Americans were self-employed in 2010, representing 14% of the workforce. It\u0027s not a fringe thing to do. They range from housekeepers, to construction workers, to web developers, to doctors. You don\u0027t need a fancy education and lots of professional connections to make this work � but if you have them, think of the advantage you\u0027ll have over the millions who managed to make it work without them. You don\u0027t need a full time employer to earn a living.]\n[CAREER INDOCTRINATION]\n[So, why do you spend most of your waking hours working as hard as possible to make somebody else richer? Well, being raised your entire life to believe that is a worthy goal has a lot to do with it. We\u0027ll talk about external barriers to self-employment later, but the biggest barrier is probably internal � you believe self-employment is just not what you\u0027re supposed to do!]\n[Indoctrination is a strong word, usually reserved for religious cults and brainwashing. But, it just means being taught a set of beliefs without questioning them. Just how much do you question the idea that you must have a job in order to be a responsible member of society? One common means of indoctrination is to instill ideas into youth before they are old enough to question them, and have the ideas come from people in authority. That�s precisely what happened as you grew up, pushed along a track into a corporate job.]\n[When you were in school, you were probably told by your parents and teachers to get good grades so you could get into college. In college, you were told to work hard so you would get a job after you graduated. And if you were lucky enough to get that job, you were absorbed into training and a culture that promotes loyalty to your employer. It�s the end result of a lifestyle choice that was indoctrinated into you at an early age.]\n[Once you landed in the professional world, you worked hard in order to get your next promotion, or to just not get fired. You\u0027ve been so busy following this path, that you haven\u0027t had time to even consider the alternatives. Meanwhile, you\u0027ve probably picked up some new responsibilities like children, a mortgage, or student loan debt � and so the idea of giving up a steady paycheck seems terrifying, even if it\u0027s barely enough to meet your financial demands.]\n[If you\u0027ve got bills to pay and mouths to feed, having a job is just what you do. You probably don\u0027t look forward to going to work in the morning � hardly anyone does. But you try to make the best of it, and fulfill the responsibilities life has thrust upon you � year after year. You hear about people starting their own businesses, but you think it\u0027s just way too risky for someone who has responsibilities beyond buying their next foam cup of Ramen noodles. You�ve developed what is known as �learned helplessness� � you aren�t happy with your stressful career, but you believe it is the best option available to you.]\n[You may think you\u0027re trapped in your career, but you\u0027re not. As with breaking any indoctrination, the first step is to understand how you got there, and develop the desire to see alternate paths. Striking out on your own and becoming self-employed is one such path that can improve your lifestyle, when done responsibly.]\n[THE CARROT ON A STICK]\n[You\u0027ve worked hard to get where you are in your career.  You probably believe you\u0027re just one more promotion away from a bigger paycheck that will change your lifestyle. Or all those shares of stock you\u0027ve been awarded in your company are really going to pay off big one day. Why would you quit, and throw all of that away?]\n[Question the rewards your career is promising you, and compare them to the rewards you could achieve on your own.]\n[If you�re working hard toward your next promotion, there are several questions you should ask yourself. Do you trust your current manager to give you that promotion, and to give you a pay increase commensurate with the increased responsibilities and stress that come with it? Do you really believe you\u0027ll win out from all of the other people struggling to get that same promotion? Are you that sure you\u0027re better than all of your other co-workers, and have a better relationship with your management than they do? The corporate career world is a zero-sum game in the end, no matter how you spin it.]\n[If you�re banking on equity that you have vesting in your employer�s company, ask yourself these questions: Do you trust the stock market with your net worth? Do you believe your hard work impacts your employer\u0027s bottom line to the degree that you materially affect its stock price, and the value of any equity you have in the company? Do you really believe that investment bankers will behave rationally, and reward good long-term behavior from your company? Are you working for a startup, and working almost exclusively for a tiny slice of the proceeds if your employer turns out to be a one-in-a-hundred acquisition success?]\n[If you�ve answered those questions honestly, you�ll see that the rewards you�re working toward are actually a pretty big gamble. You may be staying in your career out of risk-aversion, but in reality your career is a pretty risky thing, without high potential rewards.]\n[As hard as you\u0027ve worked for your employer, your employer has also worked to find ways to keep you motivated while spending as little cash as possible in the process. What do you consider a good annual raise? 3%? What sort of pay increase do you expect with a promotion? 10%? Are those stock awards really worth anything, or do they have such a long vesting schedule that they only serve to keep you around? If you�ve ever wondered if you�re just chasing the proverbial carrot on a stick, there�s a good chance you are.]\n[If you don�t get that promotion or that big raise, you�ll be told it�s because you didn�t work hard enough, or weren�t smart enough, compared to your peers. You might start doubting your own abilities and either work harder or accept less for your work as a result � which is precisely in your employer�s best interests, but not yours. All that time, however, you may have thrived working for yourself. I�m a case in point � my own corporate career hit a dead end when I had difficulty getting promoted to a Director-level job, but today my company earns more than a Director would. By focusing my efforts on building my own company instead of the self-promotion and lobbying required to achieve corporate career growth, I ended up both earning more and creating more.]\n[Let�s quantify that carrot of yours. Let�s say 10% annual growth in your income sounds like a good year to you. If you\u0027re running your own small company and it only grows 10% in a year, you should be asking yourself what you\u0027re doing wrong. The rewards your employer offers you are intentionally limited � in part to minimize their expense, and in part to prevent pay inequities.]\n[When you work for yourself, there is no upper bound to how much more money you can earn every year. And, it\u0027s entirely under your control � you are not dependent on a manager to decide you are worthy of that reward. The market rewards you based on the quality of your products and the demand for them, end of story.]\n[Let me state that again, as it\u0027s a very important point � there is no upper bound to what you can make when you are self-employed. There\u0027s also no lower bound (other than zero), but with careful planning you can mitigate that risk and choose the lower bound you\u0027re willing to accept.]\n[Face it � you�re not going to get rich working for someone else, unless you have the connections to get into the C-suite. You might think that\u0027s attainable, but the odds are very much against you. You have much better odds of attaining significant wealth working for yourself. I�m not promising to make you a millionaire � but even a much smaller number can ensure you no longer worry about money. More importantly, the freedom that comes with self-employment means you�ll have time to enjoy the experiences that money can buy. ]\n[EGO PROTECTION]\n[If you\u0027re successful in your career, you probably feel pretty good about that. Everyone wants to be liked and respected, and a corporate job can give you that. You\u0027ve probably formed some close personal bonds to some of your co-workers � working alongside others in stressful situations has that effect. It can be a hard thing to give up.]\n[When you start your own company � guess what, you\u0027re now a CEO. And a president. And whatever else you want to call yourself. Your friends won\u0027t think less of you; they\u0027ll probably respect you even more for having the guts to do it.]\n[Yes, you will lose a lot of daily face to face interaction with people. But in this day and age of social media, it\u0027s easy to stay connected with your friends. It\u0027s been three years since I quit my job and moved 3,000 miles away � but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve lost a single friend in the process. Successful self-employment will also require you to meet new, like-minded people � and if that\u0027s not enough, there are probably multiple Meetup groups you can join filled with local entrepreneurs, or people who share your other interests. Work out of a coffee shop or shared co-working space if you really need people around you all the time; the cost is minimal.]\n[In your current career, your ego is probably tied to your accomplishments at work. Think about your current goals at work � how much impact do they really have on the world, or on your life outside of work? Think about how much better it would feel to create something big on your own, that you can take full credit for! ]\n[YOUR EMPLOYER AS A SECURITY BLANKET]\n[Your employer probably takes care of a lot of things for you. They withhold taxes from your paycheck so you don\u0027t have to think about them much. They arrange for your health insurance. They contribute toward your Social Security and Medicare taxes. They pay unemployment insurance. They might contribute toward dental, vision, or life insurance as well. Someone else probably deals with all the licensing, legal requirements, and accounting associated with your employer, so you can focus on a very narrow job. That\u0027s a lot of stuff you don\u0027t need to worry about. You\u0027ve got enough to worry about already, right?]\n[When you work for yourself, you do need to arrange all of these things for yourself. And not only do you need to build a great product or service yourself, you also need to do all the stuff other people did for you at a big company. You need to be a PR specialist, a marketer, an accountant, a website developer, a manager, and a paralegal depending on the day. In all honesty, it can seem very intimidating at first.]\n[In reality, arranging insurance for you and your family is a hassle, but it\u0027s something you just have to take care of once a year. It\u0027s not that big of a deal. Maybe you have a working spouse, and you can just switch to another company\u0027s benefit plan as a result. If so, that\u0027s super easy and the cheapest way to go by far.]\n[As for all the other hats you need to wear when you\u0027re self-employed � the important thing is to understand what you\u0027re not good at, and hire others to do them for you. Need a website for your new business and you don\u0027t even know what CSS is? Find a contractor to build it for you. Similarly, there are freelance marketing and PR professionals out there you can lean on as needed. You\u0027re going to need an accountant and a lawyer anyhow; the trick is just to use them wisely. You don\u0027t have to go it alone in everything � although the more you can learn yourself, the less you\u0027ll need to spend on others.]\n[Many areas also have business incubators funded by local governments. Unlike venture capital business incubators, these resources simply provide help to local small businesses in hopes that they will grow and create more jobs in the long run. They often provide free advice and free access to local experts in the areas you need to run your business effectively, and you should take advantage of them.]\n[Yes, there are many new things you\u0027ll need to learn and take care of when you\u0027re self-employed. That\u0027s part of what makes it exciting! And there is help all around you, if you just look for it.]\n[]\n[]\n[WHY IT�S WORTH IT]\n[There are many perceived barriers to self-employment covered above. They are real; doing this is hard. However, according to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report, 90% of freelancers say they are happier now than before they were self-employed. ]\n[90%. Think about that for a minute. 55% say they would never even consider going back to work for someone else again. You rarely hear about the potential rewards of self-employment � let�s talk about why it\u0027s worth taking this leap.]\n[UNLIMITED GROWTH POTENTIAL]\n[If you understand how to create a business that can scale independently from your own time, then your business has unlimited growth potential. Unlike your corporate job, there is no upper bound on your earnings, and there is a direct relationship between your efforts and the money you make. Once you have created a product to sell, you may sell as much of it as you can to create an ongoing stream of revenue. This is called passive income, and it�s a beautiful thing. The more products you and your contractors create, the more revenue streams you have. The more time you invest in marketing, sales, and finding new markets, the more you�ll sell of the products you have. There is no limit to the number of products or sales you can achieve.]\n[Often, there is a disproportionate relationship between your effort and the rewards. One year, I increased my business by 50% just by being smarter about my online advertising. It took about a week of my time to achieve that. Could a week of effort result in a 50% pay raise in your current job? I thought not. Another year, I doubled my business by launching a new product. It took a few months of dedicated effort, but it effectively gave me a 100% pay raise that year � and it continues to grow and sell more every year. As long as I have new ideas and new ways to market and promote my products, I have every reason to believe that growth will continue over the long run.]\n[When you work for yourself, you are forced to look at every minute you spend through the lens of \"how will this activity create more ongoing revenue?\" If you devote yourself full time to such endeavors, you are the direct beneficiary of the business growth that results. That growth will still be a direct result of your hard work, but that work scales your growth at more than a 1:1 ratio.]\n[INVESTING IN YOURSELF, NOT SOMEONE ELSE]\n[Your employer presumably pays you the market rate for your time and skills. They do this because the value you generate for their business exceeds what they are paying you � otherwise, it would not be profitable. The revenue your time and effort generates for your employer is more than the money you are paid in return. If it isn\u0027t, then you should be worried about your job security. The results of your labor are making someone else amass millions of dollars. Maybe it\u0027s the executives in your company. Maybe it\u0027s a bunch of investment bankers on Wall Street who trade stock in your company. But it\u0027s probably not you � and you probably don�t have time to enjoy whatever portion of profits they do share with you.]\n[When you work for yourself, you are the direct beneficiary of the revenue your efforts create. The time you spend and the decisions you make are an investment in yourself, not for a faceless corporation. Come up with a great idea that makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year? That goes straight to your own net worth. Do the same while working for a large company, and the most you can hope for is a promotion and a 10% pay raise.]\n[The self-employed are investing in themselves, instead of in someone else, by having 100% of the fruits of their labor available for their own later use.  If your business is growing and you understand why and how to sustain that growth, investing in your own business could easily yield better returns than investing in your employer\u0027s 401(K) plan, or your employer\u0027s stock.]\n[It\u0027s not just about money, either. When you are self-employed, you are forced to learn new skills, meet new people, and to be creative. You\u0027ll grow personally across a wide range of disciplines, like it or not. The skills and bigger-picture thinking you gain is also an investment in yourself.]\n[NO DEPENDENCIES]\n[When you work for a big company, it\u0027s hard to accomplish anything alone. You\u0027ll probably need the cooperation of others. You\u0027ll depend on other teams to deliver things your project requires. You\u0027ll depend on management to remain committed to your project and not de-prioritize it without warning. You\u0027ll depend on your own teammates to deliver good work, on time. There\u0027s a lot that can happen to derail your results, and often it is outside of your control. Few things are more frustrating than failing due to the actions (or inaction) of others. It happens more often than not; according to a study in 20081, 68% of corporate technology projects fail, and over 41% of engineering time is spent developing requirements that proved to be unnecessary.]\n[When you work for yourself, your success hinges on your abilities alone. Perhaps you rely on contractors to build parts of your business, but at the end of the day you are the one who tells them what to do, and can make the decision to replace them if necessary. If you hire people, you\u0027re the one who decided to hire them. If they can\u0027t deliver what you need, it\u0027s your own fault � but you at least you have the authority to replace them. After all, you\u0027re the CEO! Nobody is going to screw up what you\u0027re doing, other than you. \"Office politics\" will no longer exist.]\n[If you are the sort of person who relies on being part of a larger team that you can lean on, this might sound scary. I\u0027ll be honest:  if this scares you, self-employment might not be for you. If you\u0027re confident in your abilities however, this lack of dependencies sounds like a very, very good thing. Your own ability to deliver is all that stands between you and your vision.]\n[NO COMMUTE]\n[An average 20-mile commute ends up costing you at least $50,000 every ten years2. The average car owner is involved in an automobile accident once every 17.9 years3. Your lifetime odds of being killed in a motor vehicle accident in the United States are a disturbing 1:1124. An automobile accident is by far the most likely way to die by injury. Your commute isn�t just draining your money, time, and energy � it could very well kill you.]\n[When you�re self-employed, it\u0027s up to you where your office is. Maybe it\u0027s just down the hallway from your bedroom. Maybe you rent a small office down the street. Perhaps you hang out at the local coffee shop once in a while just to get out. But unless you really enjoy sitting in rush-hour traffic, you can kiss that goodbye when you work for yourself.]\n[According to the US Census Bureau, the average American spends 50 minutes every day commuting to work and back. Think of what you could get done with an extra hour every day � or even how you might spend that time relaxing or recharging yourself however you like. You might actually have time for hobbies � and not dealing with traffic is a huge stress reliever in itself.]\n[It\u0027s not just time you\u0027ll get back, it\u0027s money. If you work from home, will you really need that second car? How much are you spending on gas every week just to get to work? How about on parking? Or tolls? Maintenance on your car? Bus fares? Really� go add it up. One thing that amazed me pretty quickly after becoming self-employed was how much less I spent, and how much more of my earnings I got to keep as a result. Eliminating commuting costs was a big part of that. (You\u0027ll also eat out less, which is a bigger drain on your money than you probably realize, as well as a drain on your health.)]\n[FREEDOM TO LIVE WHERE YOU WANT]\n[Why do you live where you are? Chances are it\u0027s because it\u0027s near your employer\u0027s office. Unfortunately, high-tech, high-paying jobs tend to be concentrated in places with very high costs of living. The most tech jobs exist in the San Jose, California area5, which also has a cost of living 49.3% higher than the US average6. Even if you�re making a six-figure salary in Silicon Valley, a software engineer in Austin, Texas probably has quite a bit more discretionary spending money than you do7 � not to mention less of a commute. Much of the money you�re currently spending on housing is wasted, when you consider you could live somewhere nicer for much less money.]\n[This depends on what sort of business you start for yourself, but many businesses these days may be conducted entirely online. In fact, this is a desirable business model because it opens up the entire world as your marketplace, instead of limiting yourself to your local area. If you don\u0027t have the freedom to run your business wherever you want, perhaps you\u0027re not running the right kind of business.]\n[This is where lifestyle changes really start to kick in. Want to move to the tropics, or someplace with a much lower cost of living? You have no need to live in a big, expensive metropolitan area unless you want to. Think of the money you could save, or the higher standard of living you can enjoy, by moving someplace where houses cost half of what they do in your area.]\n[Now, you shouldn\u0027t hang out a for-sale sign on your front lawn just yet � living in an expensive place probably means you\u0027re living near a lot of employment opportunities. In the early years of your business, you\u0027ll want to live close to potential employers because going back to work is one of your backup plans in case your business doesn\u0027t work out. If your current mortgage or rent is manageable, you should probably stay put until your new business is well-established. ]\n[If your business reaches the point where it is providing reliably growing income however, the sky\u0027s the limit. You can move anywhere that has an Internet connection, which is basically the entire planet at your disposal. Hawaii? Fiji? New Zealand? There\u0027s no need to dream small � it�s an attainable goal.]\n[FREEDOM TO WORK WHEN YOU WANT]\n[A 2014 Gallup poll8 showed the average full-time US worker spends 46.7 hours at the office every week. 18% spend 60 or more hours per week at work. They have very little flexibility in when those hours are spent; meetings and employer expectations dictate getting up early and coming home late for most workers.]\n[Running your own business is a lot of work, but you can usually choose when to do it. If you\u0027re running an Internet-based business, you might have customers all over the globe. 9 to 5 in your time zone is a meaningless concept � it�s always 9 AM somewhere. So, you may as well work when it\u0027s convenient for you.]\n[I do my best work in the early morning. Most days, I\u0027ve handled all of my customer support emails before I even drive my kids to school in the morning, freeing up the rest of the day for whatever new product development I want to work on �  or anything else that needs to be done, be it business or personal.]\n[No need to stress out about finding room on your calendar for that doctor\u0027s appointment, or catching the kids\u0027 school concert or award presentation. You\u0027re the boss, and the only meetings you have are the ones you made yourself with your customers. If you work from home, you won\u0027t even lose travel time to these occasional personal responsibilities.]\n[Want to work 7 to 3? 11 to 7? Nobody\u0027s going to stop you. The eight-hour work day is an arbitrary construct anyhow; you can just stop working when you feel fatigued, or you feel you\u0027ve achieved whatever goal you set for yourself today. If you\u0027re worthless after lunch, you can go relax in the pool for an hour and get back to work once your mental energy level is back up.]\n[In fact, why stop there? As the owner of your own business, you have the freedom to make your own tradeoffs between time and money. If you\u0027ve got enough revenue coming in to hire contractors or assistants to handle much of what you do, you can do so � and work less than 8 hours a day. Tim Ferriss\u0027s book \"The Four Hour Work Week\" goes into a lot of depth on this strategy. If you\u0027re smart about the kind of business you create, the title of that book actually is not hyperbole. I really could sustain my business with about 4 hours of work a week, just handling customer inquiries batched up into an hour or less per day, and directing the work of contractors. When I go on vacations with my family, that\u0027s exactly what I do. However, I still work at least 40 hours a week when I\u0027m not on vacation, because I\u0027m always trying out new things to ensure my business continues to grow. As with most things in life, you get what you put into it � and having a strong work ethic will pay dividends.]\n[\"Flexibility in work schedule\" was the top-rated benefit of self-employment in the 2012 Freelance Industry Report. You might be surprised to hear that 46% of respondents say they had more free time after working for themselves; there is a myth that the self-employed must work extra-hard in order to make ends meet, but in fact the opposite is often true. ]\n[With great freedom comes great responsibility, however. Although it might be tempting to take a 3-hour lunch break because you can, you must have the self-discipline to realize how much your time is worth as a business owner, and use it wisely. Had you spent those 3 hours on sales or marketing instead, you�d probably be a little bit richer. But, that�s your own decision to make.]\n[FREEDOM TO WORK HOW YOU WANT]\n[According to the American Psychological Association, most stress on the job arises from a sense of powerlessness. You are always doing what you�re told, to someone else�s specifications and on someone else�s timeframe. �A feeling of powerlessness is a universal cause of job stress. When you feel powerless, you\u0027re prey to depression\u0027s traveling companions, helplessness and hopelessness. You don\u0027t alter or avoid the situation because you feel nothing can be done.�9 It�s a huge problem � according to the Centers for Disease Control10, 40% of workers describe their job as �very or extremely stressful,� and this job stress is more strongly associated with health complaints than financial or family problems.]\n[If you work in a creative field, you will probably welcome the complete creative freedom you have as a self-employed individual. There are no top-down restrictions on what you make, other than those from your clients. If you\u0027re a computer programmer, you won\u0027t have to conform to some external style guide or some existing architecture � you can create your own. If you\u0027re an artist, your own personal style can show through to your work. Working without these restrictions can let you focus on what\u0027s important.]\n[Did I mention the lack of dress code when you work for yourself? If you\u0027re not meeting face to face with clients, you can wear whatever you want. No need to maintain an expensive wardrobe. Personally, I try to look professional on work days regardless; it helps to keep me in the right frame of mind.]\n[]\n[]\n[IS SELF-EMPLOYMENT FOR YOU?]\n[Self-employment offers many forms of freedom that you simply cannot have in a corporate environment. It gives you a path to unbounded growth and rewards, limited only by your own skills, talents, and time. If this all sounds good so far, it\u0027s time to get serious. Let\u0027s decide if self-employment is a path you want to try out.]\n[Is it for you? That\u0027s a very important question to answer. There are real risks to starting your own business, and you need to honestly assess your situation and your own skills before diving in. You need to understand the risks you\u0027re undertaking, and your personal likelihood of success. Even then, there are no guarantees � but going through the exercises in this chapter should at least give you a better idea of where you stand.]\n[It can all end unimaginably well, but it can also end badly. We want to make sure the odds are in your favor � if not, perhaps you should spend some more time in the conventional workforce building up more savings and developing more skills. Self-employment may be for you, but just not now.]\n[FLOWCHART: SHOULD I EVEN CONSIDER SELF-EMPLOYMENT?]\n[There is risk involved with self-employment. Minimizing that risk means ensuring you have a financial cushion in place, as well as a plan for dealing with health care expenses. If you\u0027re going to put yourself in a position where you are truly betting the farm by quitting your job, we need to identify that right now, and you need to store this book until your situation changes.]\n[Here\u0027s a flowchart that will at least tell you if you\u0027re taking a crazy risk by even thinking about this. ]\n[]\n[If you\u0027re reading this on a device that can\u0027t display this flowchart well, I\u0027ll describe its main points:]\n[HAVING A FINANCIAL SAFETY NET]\n[Assuming you\u0027ve done the initial legwork and product development for your new business before quitting your day job, we\u0027re going to say you\u0027ll need at least 3 months to figure out if you can really earn a living from it �  and if not, another month to find a new job instead. You may want to increase or decrease that estimate, depending on the employment market for people with your particular skills and experience. If you�re burning up the last months� worth of your reserves, the following month needs to show more income from your business than your monthly expenses add up to. If not, then it�s time to go back to work and try again later.  That means you\u0027ll need at least 4 months of living expenses saved up, just in case your big idea turns out to be a complete bust. A few months doesn�t sound like enough time to prove a business is viable, but we will be doing a lot of testing before you quit your day job. In reality you have as much time as you need, if you factor in the time you spend developing your business on the side.]\n[If you\u0027re lucky, you have a supportive spouse or parents who can pay the bills during this time. If you\u0027re not so lucky, you need to save this money up first. And I\u0027m talking about cash savings here � money you can easily withdraw if needed, without penalties. How much cash are we talking about? Don\u0027t make the mistake of adding up your basic living expenses such as rent, your cell phone bill, etc. You probably spend a lot more every month than you realize, and no matter how much you tell yourself you can just tighten your belt and spend less for a while, in reality that\u0027s much harder to do than you think. Instead, go get your last 6 months of bank statements, and figure out how much you actually spend on average every month. Multiply that number by 4, and that\u0027s what you need sitting in your savings account. If you have any large expenses looming ahead of you, like tax payments, be sure to factor that in as well.]\n[If you don\u0027t have that much money in your bank account today, think about if you will in the near future. Do you have a bonus coming up? Stock grants that are vesting? A big tax refund? Something you can sell that you don\u0027t want any longer? Those are good ways to fund your endeavor.]\n[You might also consider doing some freelance or contract work to help pay the bills while your business spins up. This is a great idea, but I wouldn\u0027t rely on that revenue. It\u0027s all too common for contracts to go bad, and to have trouble collecting on your invoices in a timely manner. It\u0027s also a little too tempting to lean on freelance revenue, instead of investing your time into building a business that can grow beyond the number of billable hours you can work each month.]\n[Do NOT take out a loan to do this, from anyone. There is a very real possibility that your endeavor will fail, and you don\u0027t want to be saddled with debt after you\u0027ve already depleted your savings. Don\u0027t take a loan from Uncle Bob, don\u0027t take out a home equity loan, and don�t bet your kids\u0027 college fund or your retirement fund. And for God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t plan to just max out your credit cards. Just don\u0027t. If you don\u0027t have the cash to do this responsibly, put this book away until you do. Remember about 50% of new business fail, and that�s a very real possibility you must plan for. Even if your business succeeds, you�ll be paying interest on that loan that you could have avoided by building up your business with your own money over time, on the side.  If you\u0027re reading this book because you lost your job and you don\u0027t have the savings or severance package you need to try self-employment, focus your efforts on finding a new job instead.]\n[I mean that.]\n[PLANNING FOR HEALTH CARE]\n[If you live in a country with universal health care coverage, then you probably don\u0027t need to worry about this too much. For our readers in the United States however, health insurance is now a very big problem for the self-employed � and it\u0027s something you need to consider before deciding to take the leap.]\n[The laws surrounding this are changing every year, so it\u0027s a good idea to do some research of your own. As of this writing in 2015, health care expenses for the successfully self-employed in the United States are extremely high. I�m not making a political statement, but the fact is my own self-employment health insurance premiums doubled with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (�Obamacare�,) and I was left with worse coverage than I had before as well. Perhaps by the time you�ve read this, subsidies for small business owners will exist, so it�s worth checking if the system has since been improved to be friendlier to the self-employed.]\n[As of now however, your best option is to add yourself as a dependent on an employer-provided health plan offered to your spouse or parents.  If their employer subsidizes health care at all, then it will certainly be a much cheaper option than purchasing your own health insurance � not to mention far less complicated.  Ask them to find out what it would cost to add you to their plan, and figure that into your planned monthly expenses. We can just move on. If you will need to provide your own health insurance, keep reading.]\n[How do you figure out if you have enough savings to provide your own health insurance? If you won\u0027t be covered by someone else\u0027s insurance and you live in the U.S., visit www.healthcare.gov. It\u0027s pretty easy to find out what sorts of plans will be available to you once you are self-employed, and what they cost. The cost will vary depending on your income, so to be conservative assume your business will be successful and you will not receive any government subsidies to offset the premium costs.]\n[Done? I bet you\u0027ve got a good case of sticker shock now. Depending on your age and the size of your family, you\u0027re probably looking at monthly premiums on the order of $1,000 per month for a plan that won\u0027t pay for anything until you\u0027ve paid about $10,000 or more out-of-pocket for health care expenses. Don\u0027t bother being angry about it. There\u0027s nothing you can do about it, and you are required by law to have this coverage.  You just have to plan for it.]\n[We also need to think about that pesky deductible.  Let\u0027s say you do have a $10,000 deductible. If you\u0027re in good health, you can take a risk and bet that you won\u0027t incur any health care expenses while you\u0027re testing out your business in its first few months. But the prudent thing is to assume something will go horribly wrong, and you\u0027ll somehow find yourself with a $10,000 medical bill during this time.  One trip to the hospital is all it takes. You really should have the amount of your deductible saved up somewhere, in addition to your 4 months of living expenses. Otherwise, you\u0027re taking a big gamble.]\n[You now have some numbers to factor into your planned savings� budget for health care. Do you still have enough saved up to cover your expenses for the first few months, with those health care costs factored in? If so, great�we can move on. If not, you need to come up with a plan to save more, and revisit this book once you have the necessary reserves.]\n[]\n[]\n[SELF-ASSESSMENT QUIZ]\n[If you\u0027ve gotten this far, you\u0027ve got the financial safety net and health care planning you need to try out self-employment. But just because you can try self-employment doesn\u0027t mean you should.]\n[There is nothing scientific about the following self-assessment quiz; it is merely a collection of qualities I\u0027ve found to be essential during my own self-employment. The more you have, the better. But if you only have a few, self-employment may not be for you. Be honest, now!]\n[Quiz: Do I Have the Qualities for Successful Self-Employment?]\n[Just count up the number of positive responses to the following questions.]\n[___ I was successful in my chosen career due to my ability to consistently deliver results in a timely manner.]\n[___ I\u0027m at my most productive when working alone, without a large team to back me up.]\n[___ I can think of several examples where I successfully taught myself a new skill in a short amount of time.]\n[___ I don\u0027t leave projects half-finished; I always put in the effort required to finish them. An unfinished product has zero value!]\n[___ I am consistently responsive to people who contact me. I don\u0027t just ignore emails and voice-mails.]\n[___ I manage my time well, and rarely feel overwhelmed as a result.]\n[___ I am good at focusing on the task at hand and tuning out distractions.]\n[___ I\u0027ve been told that I have good communication skills.]\n[___ I have at least 100 professional connections in my social networks.]\n[___ I have the self-discipline to work hard without a boss monitoring me.]\n[What\u0027s your score?]\n[8-10: You possess the personal qualities required to pull this off. Look at the one or two items you didn\u0027t check off however � they are still important, and you should think about how you can either augment these skills, or contract someone else to help you out with them.]\n[6-8: Self-employment will not come easily to you, but the necessity of putting food on the table will probably motivate you to overcome the qualities you\u0027re missing in the end. As before, finding ways to address the personal qualities you\u0027re missing either through training or purchasing the services of others will be important.]\n[0-5: I\u0027m not so sure self-employment is the best choice for you, but you\u0027re not so different from most people who are self-employed. The thing is, most self-employed people are just getting by, earning on average about $40,000 per year working as independent housekeepers, child-care workers, construction workers, and the like (Census data, aggregated QuickBooks data, and BLS data agree on that number). If you want your business to be a runaway success, you should consider partnering with someone who possesses the qualities you lack, and whom you can implicitly trust � but only once you\u0027re in a financial position to share your revenue with a partner. You can see the Catch-22 there. You may be better off working for someone else, unless $40,000 per year is more than you\u0027re earning now. Keep in mind there is no guarantee you will earn that much, or anything for that matter.]\n[At this point, we\u0027ve determined whether you are in a position to try self-employment, and a rough idea of your outlook for success. What\u0027s your decision? Try going it on your own, or continue to focus on your career? There\u0027s no wrong answer; self-employment is not for everyone. But if you are going to try self-employment � you are about to embark on an adventure you\u0027ll never forget. I want it to end well, and the next two parts of this book will tell you all I know about making that happen.]\n[]\n[]\n[PART II: MAKING IT HAPPEN]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[]\n[DESIGNING A BUSINESS FOR YOUR LIFESTYLE]\n[Maybe you already have an idea of what you\u0027ll do when you are self-employed. But, the obvious choice isn\u0027t always the right one. This section will help you plan for the long term, maximize your lifestyle benefits, and build a business that can grow independently from your time.]\n[You don\u0027t have to get your business idea right the first time; what you do will and should evolve over time, as your customers and the marketplace changes. Ultimately you\u0027ll want to offer a wide variety of products and services in order to diversify your offerings and make your income more reliable. In the short term, all that\u0027s important is finding a way to pay the bills without a paycheck. You\u0027ll learn as you go. Get one of those Moleskine notebooks, and keep notes of all the information, advice, ideas, and learnings you acquire along the way. Revisiting those thoughts later will help you continually refine your business and find new business ideas to try out.]\n[You need to start with something, however. Many will rely on freelance work during this initial period, but freelance work does not realize the full potential of freedom and lifestyle self-employment can offer.  As a freelancer, time really is money. Your growth potential is limited by the number of billable hours you can work in a week. You\u0027re still working for other people � your clients � and developing things according to their specifications. They might even demand that you work on-site. In many cases, you\u0027re just working as a contractor so your clients can avoid the expenses of providing benefits to you and employing you over a longer period of time. As mentioned earlier, 90% of freelancers do believe their lifestyle is better than traditional employment � but you can do even better. You should have another revenue stream gestating that can take its place over time. As a freelancer, your clients have no expectation that you only work on their tasks. You are free to pursue your long-term objectives at the same time. We\u0027re going to explore what kind of objective you should have in mind.]\n[THE FALLACY OF THE GROWTH BUSINESS]\n[When you hear about entrepreneurs and people starting their own business, the press tends to focus on what is known as \"growth businesses.\" These are the startups you hear about in Silicon Valley, or the small businesses you see on TV on \"Shark Tank.\" They seek large amounts of investment at an early stage, amass large amounts of debt, and attempt to grow their business as quickly as possible to create a revenue stream that offsets that initial investment. Their ultimate goal is usually to sell the company to a larger company, and get rich in the process through whatever personal stake they may still have in it. At that point, the investors get rich as well.]\n[The problem is: it very rarely works out that way in the end.]\n[93% of companies started by the much-touted \"Y Combinator\" business accelerator in Silicon Valley ultimately fail, according to a 2013 article from Business Insider11. This is consistent with the common wisdom that only one out of ten startups succeeds. Venture capitalists invest in a wide range of companies with the expectation that most will fail, but the rare one that succeeds will offset those losses for them.]\n[Even of the startups that are sold to a larger company in the end, most are what are considered \"acqui-hires.\" The startup actually failed to create a sustainable revenue stream, and is only being acquired as a way to hire a bunch of talented people at once. Usually the only real reward to the founder in this case is that they have a traditional job again. If your ultimate goal is to become a project manager at Apple, then that\u0027s great. But that\u0027s not what this book is about.]\n[If you\u0027re at a point in your life where you have the ability to live on a shoestring for years in exchange for a 10% chance at riches, AND you have an idea awesome enough to attract significant venture capital, well, I can\u0027t stop you. If you think you can found the next Oculus or WhatsApp that gets acquired for an outrageous sum of money, and you can accept working ridiculously hard for very little money for years for the slim chance of that happening, go for it.]\n[I should also point out that unless you live in Silicon Valley or New York, and are a 20-something male, the odds are even further against you.  (See \"The Brutal Ageism of Tech\", New Republic, \"Why Women Should Get The Hell Out of Ageist, Sexist Companies\", Inc., or any of the other 212,000 results you\u0027ll get when searching for \"ageism and sexism in Silicon Valley\".) Venture capitalists want young, energetic founders who will happily work for next to nothing � and they seem to like founders that remind them of themselves in college. It\u0027s not fair, but that\u0027s the world we live in. I�m hopeful that the sexism in venture capital will subside as more attention is drawn to it, but ageism seems likely to persist.]\n[If your business isn\u0027t tech-related to begin with, you\u0027re going to have a hard time finding venture capital at all. There are funds that don\u0027t focus exclusively on tech, or focus on women or minority-owned businesses, but they are the exception.]\n[However, there is a much less risky path � one where you get to keep your free time, your money, and your freedom. You\u0027ll have a lower chance of becoming a billionaire, but you have a higher chance of living a rich lifestyle.]\n[INTRODUCING THE LIFESTYLE BUSINESS]\n[The astute may say, \"Only one in ten startups survive? Didn\u0027t you say earlier in this book that half of all new businesses last five years or more?\" I did. Both statements are true � but most businesses are not startup \"growth businesses.\" They are lifestyle businesses.]\n[A startup business is designed to grow fast, above all else. In contrast, a lifestyle business exists for the sole purpose of providing revenue and freedom to you and your family over the long run.]\n[All those family-owned restaurants, barber shops, pool cleaners, landscapers, roofing companies, freelancers, and people selling crafts or imported goods online are running a lifestyle business. Their objective is not to grow into a company that employs thousands of people, or to get acquired by Google for billions of dollars. Their goal is to simply do what they love to do on their own terms, and earn enough money doing it such that they can enjoy life and some freedom. You rarely hear about how these companies come to be, but you\u0027re surrounded by them all the time.]\n[This is a much more attainable goal. You don\u0027t need to be a landscaper or a restaurateur to do it; there are even better options � ones that don\u0027t involve the responsibility of hiring and managing others, or being tied to a single physical location.]\n[PLANNING THE IDEAL LIFESTYLE BUSINESS]\n[When planning for a new lifestyle business, we want to maximize all of the benefits of self-employment we discussed earlier. Your business should be designed to do so from the start. Let\u0027s review those benefits, and how your business can realize them to their fullest.]\n[Unlimited growth potential. Your business should create products that can create an ongoing revenue stream with minimal further investment of your own time. Your time is limited, and a business that can only grow with the time you put into it cannot scale. A freelancer\u0027s business cannot scale beyond that freelancer\u0027s available time; but building a marketplace for freelancers can. The ideal situation is to create digital products with some time up front, which can then sell themselves indefinitely through online purchasing and distribution, completely automatically. Even your marketing can be largely automated through targeted online ads and building a website optimized for conversions. Physical products can work the same way, if you can outsource the production and distribution of your product at a reasonable cost.]\n[Investing in yourself, not someone else. You want to avoid the need to take on investors or debt in order to start your business. Instead, create a business you may bootstrap using the time and money you have available while you\u0027re still employed. Investors generally are not interested in funding a lifestyle business anyhow � they want a slice of a big payoff at the end, and have no interest in your lifestyle. Bank loans for small businesses are difficult to come by these days (unless they are backed by collateral), which really only leaves bootstrapping and crowd-funding as options anyhow. This is all for the best, however. Self-funding your new business means that you have no investors who can demand that you do things their way, and it means that the profits from your business are entirely your own going forward. The good news is that many modern businesses do not require a large cash outlay up front � often, all you need is a website, a computer, and an Internet connection � plus that financial safety net we talked about earlier.]\n[No dependencies. Think about what or who your new business will depend upon for success. Of course, you\u0027ll depend on your customer base � but are there other dependencies outside of your control that could get in your way? A good example is a company that relies on government contracts. Will you get paid the next time Congress forces the government into a temporary shutdown? Do you know all of the arcane paperwork and regulations that are required in order to actually get paid by the government in a timely manner? Do you know how long it takes for a government contract to get awarded before you receive a penny from it? There\u0027s a lot in this example that\u0027s outside of your control, which can absolutely kill a new business that\u0027s starting out. A more common problem is relying on suppliers for your business that may not be able to deliver what you need on time or to your specifications. If you�re selling stuff that other people provide, make sure you have a pool of potential suppliers to use in case one doesn�t work out.]\n[Freedom to work where you want. If your business requires physical interaction with people, you\u0027re thinking too small. By tying yourself to people in a specific location, you are both giving up some freedom and limiting your growth potential. Instead of planning to open up a beauty salon for local individuals, consider selling beauty products on the Internet to people around the entire world all at once. Then, if your business becomes successful, you have the freedom to move to Tahiti without losing a single customer in the process.]\n[If freedom from commuting and freedom of location are important to you, it\u0027s also important to plan a business that does not involve hiring employees that require your physical oversight. As your business grows, can you start hiring freelancers and independent contractors remotely to help out? Can you outsource much of what you do? If so, that\u0027s a business that can scale beyond your own time and one that offers the most freedom. If your business is such that you must hire people that require face-to-face management in order to grow, then you\u0027re going to find yourself tied to an office where you must be physically present at least as long as your employees are. You\u0027re giving up a lot of the benefits of self-employment in that case.]\n[No commute. One of those benefits is not dealing with a daily commute, and reclaiming those hours of your life. If your customers are all concentrated inside the city, you live in the suburbs, and your product is such that you need a physical presence with your customers � you�re doing it wrong on many counts. First of all, the fact that you require a physical presence with your customers violates the first tenet of \"unlimited growth potential\" � you can only make as many sales as you have time to see your customers physically. Maybe you\u0027re a contractor who must be at a client\u0027s office you must commute to � but again, such a business cannot scale beyond the time you have available. ]\n[Freedom to work when you want. Yet again, this comes back to the theme of not creating a business that requires face-to-face contact with your clients. If your business is one such that you supply products, not services, to customers � then as long as you respond to their messages within a day, they will generally be happy. You can choose to batch up all of those messages and handle them in the same hour every day, or respond to them throughout whatever window of time you decide to dedicate to your work. But when that is remains up to you, and you have the flexibility to change it as needed.]\n[Avoiding employees, or contractors who require close supervision, is also required to let you manage your time as you see fit. If you have someone working for you from 9-5 that isn\u0027t experienced enough to work independently, then you too need to be available from 9-5. If you aren\u0027t, you\u0027ll have someone wasting their time figuring stuff out on their own, or doing things incorrectly, and still sticking you with the bill for that time.]\n[Freedom to work how you want. A big part of why you\u0027re considering self-employment is because you want to be your own boss. But certain kinds of businesses afford more creative freedom than others. As mentioned earlier, freelancing is a good way to keep paying the bills during the early stage of your business, but as a freelancer you\u0027re just trading your old boss for a bunch of new ones: your clients, who all want things produced to their exact specifications. Working for a client as a freelancer isn\u0027t all that much different than being an employee, except you probably don\u0027t have to go to as many meetings, and you\u0027re hopefully paid more per hour to compensate for your lack of benefits.]\n[I will again caution against taking on investors, even it\u0027s from Uncle Bob or Mom \u0026 Dad. As soon as someone other than you has a financial stake in your endeavor, they will probably want some ability to call the shots. It may be well-meaning advice, but if their money is on the line, you can bet they expect you to act upon it. Free advice, without strings, is easy to get � you don\u0027t need investors for that. This is why I advise starting your business before you quit your day job, if at all possible. Choosing a business that does not require a large cash outlay up front can make that possible. ]\n[My advice so far is admittedly self-centered. I\u0027m telling you to avoid hiring people, avoid involving investors, and avoid creating a business that depends on strong ties to your local community.  This might go against everything you\u0027ve been taught all your life about being a good member of the community. If you want to remain tied to that community indefinitely and have your schedule revolve around them, that\u0027s fine. Perhaps creating local jobs and new, deeper relationships with members of your community is in fact what motivates you. I won\u0027t stop you. Just understand what you\u0027re giving up � if your business takes off, you\u0027re still going to be tied to a local office working 9-5. You won\u0027t have the option to up and move someplace warm and work whenever you want to, without the need to sell your company or to give up its revenue stream. Working out of a beachside caf� in Hawaii a few years from now will be how your story ends, only if you craft your business with that end in mind. To maximize your personal freedom, your business must be portable, global, and avoid full-time employees that cannot be easily replaced or managed remotely.]\n[]\n[]\n[CASE STUDY: SUNDOG SOFTWARE]\n[This isn\u0027t all just empty advice � it reflects what I\u0027ve actually done myself. So, let me give you the story of my own company, Sundog Software LLC, and how it was designed to maximize the advantages of self-employment. In all honesty, \"designed\" might be too strong of a word � a lot of it was lucky choices. But you can learn from how it worked out.]\n[Sundog Software specializes in real-time computer graphics software for environmental effects. Think of skies, clouds, and oceans in video games, training simulators, and the like. It\u0027s a niche, but it\u0027s something I enjoy and do well. I license my software to companies like big defense contractors, aerospace companies, flight simulator enthusiasts, and game developers. Today it earns over $300,000 per year in revenue, and the vast majority of that is profit.]\n[It has unlimited growth potential, because after developing this software, I\u0027m able to sell it to as many people as I want to without investing significant additional time. I do need to fix bugs and keep my products modern, but those efforts are shared with all of my customers at once. There is no linear relationship with my number of customers and the number of hours I need to work.]\n[My software is a digital product, so I have no costs for manufacturing or shipping to deal with. Customers all over the world can order software licenses on my website with a credit card, at which point they automatically receive a download of their product. Online advertising campaigns seek out new customers and direct them to my website automatically. Prospective customers may obtain product information, demos, and trial versions from my website without interacting with me at all. I literally earn money while I sleep.]\n[I started developing this software as a hobby, while I was still working in a conventional job. Since it\u0027s something I enjoy, it didn\u0027t really feel like work. But I soon realized that what I made had commercial value, and I started offering it for sale online at a low price just to test the market. I used some bonus money to pay a web designer to develop a WordPress-based storefront for my new product, and quickly earned that money back.]\n[Note that I was careful to review the terms of my employment at the time. They were remarkably generous with regards to side endeavors such as this. Still, I was careful to only work on this using my own time and equipment. If you aren\u0027t careful about this sort of thing, you could end up with your current employer laying a claim to whatever you created on your own, or being upset about your \"moonlighting\" enough to put your day job in jeopardy. Even though I knew I was playing by the rules in my case (and it was actually helping to keep my technical skills up for my day job), it\u0027s still not something I talked about much at work.]\n[The important point is that I did not take out any loans or outside investment to get a proof-of-concept product into the market. I did it on my own time, with my own money, while I still had a steady source of income. This way, I was only investing in myself � the company that resulted was entirely mine.]\n[By the time I was forced to leave my day job due to personal circumstances, even the 10 hours or so per week I was devoting to my little \"hobby\" was resulting in almost enough revenue to live off of. I had enough saved up to cover living expenses for a few months, and I could afford to provide my own health insurance for a while. So, I took a gamble that with a full-time effort, I could grow this business into something my family could live comfortably from.]\n[I started off doing a lot of freelance work as a software developer, and found that with my professional connections and the demand for experienced software engineers, it was surprisingly easy to come by. I was also surprised to find that nobody even blinks at paying $150 per hour for an experienced software engineer. My paranoia about depleting my savings and having to seek a new job went away pretty quickly. But I was still working hard to meet the high expectations my clients had, so in many ways it still felt like I had a job, and not a business.]\n[At the same time, I was investing just as much time into growing Sundog Software. I worked to optimize my automated targeted marketing through Google AdWords and display ads on specific websites. I raised my prices after evaluating the market. I started sending press releases out to publications my customers read, which doesn\u0027t cost anything. I started building up an email list and sending out regular newsletters. All of that paid off, and money from freelancing soon just became extra income. I stopped seeking new freelance work after a few months.]\n[At this point, I was working entirely out of my home, so I had no commute. All I needed to create my software and market it was a computer and an Internet connection. I was creating all of this on my own, so I had no dependencies � nobody could stop me from delivering my product. My products were intentionally of a scope such that I could build them myself, but still be large and complex enough that they would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.]\n[Growing my business occasionally required skills or time that I didn\u0027t have. But instead of hiring employees I wasn\u0027t sure I could afford in the long run, I contracted out specific tasks to other freelance software developers and artists that worked out of their own offices using their own equipment. Since these freelancers were experienced enough to work independently given spec�d out work, I was able to hire them from across the globe and without face to face interaction. This way, I preserved my freedom to work where I want.]\n[Since I was selling my product over the Internet, I soon found myself with customers all over the world, from every time zone. There was no expectation to meet with me face to face, because they knew I lived far away. Had I restricted myself to selling in my immediate area, my business would not have lasted a month. E-mail communication with my customers became the norm, and as long as they received a response within a day, they felt I was being responsive. So, I could choose whatever part of the day I wanted to communicate with my customers, preserving my freedom to work when I want. In fact, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s much more efficient to let these messages pile up for a day and deal with them all at once, rather than waiting around all day for new messages to come in that you must respond to.]\n[At no point did I take on outside investment, a partner, or a board of advisors with a stake in the company. So, I had the freedom to work how I want. As someone who is newly self-employed, you will need advice from others, but I found this through my local business incubator and by interviewing CEO\u0027s of other, similar small companies that did not compete directly with my own. This gave me lots of free, but non-binding, advice to work with.]\n[An important choice was choosing a business that delivers digital goods over the Internet � ones that are not easily replicated by others.  A digital, Internet-based business may be run from anywhere on any schedule, and scales up seamlessly. The other important choice was designing a business that could be managed single-handedly, with help from the occasional contractor or freelancer. This prevented getting tied down to a physical office with full-time employees to manage, while still allowing for growth in the company.]\n[]\n[]\n[OTHER LIFESTYLE BUSINESS IDEAS]\n[You don\u0027t have to be a software developer to maximize the benefits of self-employment. Here are some other ideas of businesses that scale well without needing to hire a large full-time staff:]\n[Selling stuff on the Internet. It\u0027s still possible to earn a decent living selling unique goods on sites like Amazon, EBay, and Etsy. The trick is finding a niche that isn\u0027t currently well-served. What weird things are you passionate about? Is it just weird enough that there aren\u0027t many people producing merchandise for that interest, but not so weird that there is no real market for it? The other trick is selling something unique � if you\u0027re selling some commodity like electronics that any other retailer can offer, probably at a lower price, people will have no reason to buy from you.  Do your research � search for existing offerings and understand your competition before diving in. Also research the size of the market; get a Google AdWords account, and that will let you look up the popularity of specific search terms, which is a decent metric of what interests are more popular than others. Through the magic of drop-shipping, you may be even be able to separate yourself from the work of producing and distributing your product. This is also something you can try out on the weekends, before quitting your day job.]\n[Build an Online Marketplace for Services. Although I generally recommend selling products instead of services, in this case, services are the product. You\u0027re not directly responsible for the services provided; you just connect contractors and freelancers with clients for a fee. Angie\u0027s List is one extreme of this idea, but you could imagine building similar marketplaces for niche industries. Finding reliable software engineer freelancers, for example, is still a challenge. Again, this is an idea you can start up with minimal cash and time up front, and see if it grows before quitting the day job.]\n[Write Books. I\u0027m trying this one out right now, myself! I saw that there were surprisingly few books on the topic of self-employment and lifestyle businesses, and writing one isn\u0027t that much work � so why not try it? Once it\u0027s written, it can generate revenue for years. If you have an area of expertise that\u0027s in demand, but niche enough that there aren\u0027t a lot of traditional educational options on it � odds are other people want to learn about it, and might stumble across your book in the process. Now that self-publishing and digital distribution of books is actually a viable business model, a book sold for a few dollars can still reach a large number of readers and generate decent income. As with everything, it\u0027s about finding an underserved niche � I hope the world needs this book, but it probably doesn\u0027t need another vampire romance novel.]\n[Develop Online Courses. As college tuition becomes increasingly expensive, more people are turning to online courses such as those offered through Coursera, Udemy, and General Assembly. These companies rely on instructors to create these courses, and in some cases share the profits with them. If you have a niche skill that�s in demand, creating some instructional videos on these platforms will generate ongoing revenue streams. Some people make entire businesses out of instructional content creation.]\n[Build a website that helps people find hard-to-find stuff. For years, I\u0027ve been scouring art fairs trying to find a painting that will actually look good on my wall at a reasonable price. That wall is still empty. That\u0027s just one example of a market where people have money to spend, but a hard time actually spending it. There are so many artisans out there in the world that it can be hard to find something that fits your own tastes and needs among all the other stuff that\u0027s available. Solving that problem in a creative way could be valuable, and perhaps extensible to areas other than art.]\n[None of these ideas are guaranteed to be successful, but they are all things you can potentially prototype just with your own spare time, throw them out there, and see if they have legs. Other ways to get your creative juices flowing would be to watch \"Shark Tank\" or similar shows where investors evaluate small businesses on TV, subscribe to a feed from TechCrunch to see what ideas are coming out of Silicon Valley, and most importantly � find enough time to actually be able to think creatively. If you\u0027re running yourself ragged from your day job\u0027s day to day responsibilities, you\u0027ll be hard pressed to find the mental energy to conjure up original ideas. Instead of leaning in to your career, perhaps you\u0027re better off leaning out a bit.]\n[Also, stay vigilant for unsolved problems you encounter in your day to day life. Have you ever searched for a certain kind of product only to find it is unavailable or hard to find? Did you do anything today that forced you to waste time you\u0027d rather have back? These may represent opportunities to fill an underserved need with your own business. Keep a list of these opportunities as you run across them, and eventually one may get you excited enough to do something about it.]\n[]\n[]\n[KEY POINTS WHEN EVALUATING YOUR BUSINESS IDEA]\n[If you\u0027ve got an idea of what you\u0027d like to do while self-employed, here are a few good questions to ask yourself.]\n[Can I test this idea before I quit my day job? This question is important for two reasons: one, it evaluates if you can eliminate the risk involved in trying out your idea � worst case, you still have your day job. Two, it validates this is something you can accomplish yourself or with minimal freelance help. That makes it much easier to self-fund, it keeps your ongoing expenses low, and it frees you from the responsibilities that come with hiring people. Remember to check your employment agreement, and ensure working on this business won�t violate the terms of your employment or compete with your current employer.]\n[Does this idea scale well? A digital product, or a product that can be manufactured by others, will free up your time after the initial product creation. Once your product is developed, you can focus on things like PR, marketing, and developing new products to grow your business further. You can sell as many of them as you wish. In contrast, a product you must personally create by hand for each customer is limited by the amount of time you have to create it. Even worse, selling your time as a service billed hourly can never scale beyond the number of productive hours you have in a week. Products and information may be replicated without limit, but your time is fixed in quantity.]\n[Have I found an underserved niche? Sundog Software started with the observation that realistic 3D clouds were very hard to produce in flight simulators and games. Yet, this niche was not so small that there was no business to be had � big companies with very deep pockets are behind many simulators and games. Ask yourself what solutions already exist for the problem your business will solve, and whether you can do it better or at lower cost. If the answer is yes, do some research on your market to make sure there is enough demand for your product to end up paying your bills.]\n[Estimating market sizes is probably worthy of another book of its own. Websites such as Alexa, or the keyword tool in Google AdWords, can be useful for measuring trends and overall interest for a given topic. Some key advice is to always estimate a market size from the bottom-up, instead of from the top-down. For example, don\u0027t estimate the size of your market by saying X% of the 7 billion people on the planet might be interested in it � that will almost always grossly overestimate it. Instead, start with a more realistic estimate of the number of customers in your local area or in similar niches, and work your way up. You want to find how many people will actually shell out their hard-earned cash for your product, not how many are just potentially interested in it.]\n[You also need to understand any existing competitors in your niche. How will your company differentiate itself? How much of your sales do you expect competitors to consume initially, and in the long term? The market you have found may not be entirely yours, and you need to factor that into your revenue projections.]\n[Market research is a field unto itself, but you don�t have to make a science out of it. Use whatever data you can find to estimate the number of potential customers for your product, and use the Internet to discover competitors and how they seem to be doing. In the end, estimating your market size is an educated guess. You just want to educate yourself with any relevant data and competitive intelligence you can find.]\n[Do my customers have money? I made this mistake myself once. My business started off selling primarily to big defense contractors and aerospace companies with big budgets, but my products were also relevant to video game developers. My market research showed there were over a million people across the world that call themselves game developers � so marketing to them seemed like a sure path to riches. What I didn\u0027t take into consideration is that the vast majority of game developers are kids living at home, using free tools to create games that will never see the light of day. Even the ones that are doing it professionally are usually working with little to no budget. I found plenty of customers in game development � but very little revenue. Make sure your potential customers not only have an interest in your product, but also the budgets or disposable income required to purchase it at the price you need to make a profit.]\n[Can I sell this globally? Can you accept orders over the Internet, and deliver your product or services wherever it is needed? If so, you are maximizing the size of your market, and also insulating yourself from economic or political crises that may be specific to one country. As an example, the US restricted its defense spending in recent years. If my only customers were in the US training and simulation industry, my business would be stagnant � but now, most of my customers are in Canada, Europe or Asia instead, and business continues to grow.]\n[If you are selling globally, then you are also competing globally. Understanding your competition on a global scale then becomes especially important. Is someone in a country with a lower cost of living already offering what you do just as well, but at a much lower cost? If so, that\u0027s a problem.]\n[Can I automate sales and marketing? If you are selling your products globally over the Internet, traditional sales techniques such as cold-calling and doing in-person demos simply cannot scale. Hiring a salesperson probably won\u0027t help you, since that person can\u0027t be everywhere at once.]\n[Can you find new customers through what they are searching for on Google, or what demographics and interests they state they have on Facebook? Are there specific websites or publications that your customers tend to visit that you could advertise on? Can you direct these people to a web page designed to get them to try out your product, right then and there, free of obligation and with little expense to you?]\n[If you can answer yes to those questions, then you may be able to automate much of your sales and marketing. Since we\u0027re trying to maximize the value you get out of your business with limited human resources, it\u0027s important to build systems that can allow a customer to discover, evaluate, and buy your product without involving you personally.]\n[Is this business hard to replicate? With seven billion people in the world and more getting born every minute, it\u0027s hard to find a unique idea. When you do, it probably won\u0027t stay unique for long � and the niche you are serving can only support so many of you. If you\u0027re selling a physical product, see if it\u0027s something you can at least apply for a provisional patent for. This is basically a way to protect your idea at a low cost for a period of time, while you build up enough profit to pay for a real patent application (that will run you about $10,000 by the way). Your patent is only as good as your ability to defend it, but having one will make it easier to sell your business in the future. I am not a lawyer, so you\u0027ll need to talk to yours for details.]\n[If your business is not something that lends itself to patent or copyright protection, you at least need to make sure what you are doing is unlikely to be replicated. Sometimes this means you are leveraging your own unique skills, interests, and talents to do something that is insurmountably hard for most others. Even a patent or copyright is no guarantee your work won\u0027t be stolen � what can you really do if someone on the other side of the planet takes your work and starts selling it as their own? Be sure to take steps to make that as difficult to do as possible, because it will happen. It happened to me. As much as people hate digital rights management, it is something you must think about if you plan to make a living selling digital products. Don�t buy into the idea that pirates wouldn�t have paid for your digital goods anyhow � once one of my own products for amateur game developers showed up on a popular pirate site, its sales went almost to zero.]\n[Is a large company likely to decide they want your market, throw more resources at it than you will ever have, and offer a competing product for free just to gain the market? That\u0027s a really fast way to go out of business; the most you can hope for is that they\u0027ll want to acquire you first, or hire you after they\u0027ve ruined you. Your only real protection against this, apart from patent protection, is to serve a niche that large companies are unlikely to find interesting enough to go after. I\u0027m quite happy with a few hundred thousand dollars per year coming out of my little niche, but that\u0027s chump change to a large company and not even worth talking about.]\n[If you really have found a millions-of-dollars-per-year opportunity and you can\u0027t protect it, it\u0027s probably a matter of time before a larger company will identify that same opportunity. In this case, you may be better off going down the riskier \"growth business\" path instead of a lifestyle business, with the objective of gaining traction in the marketplace before others do, and getting acquired by that larger company down the road. That\u0027s all a big gamble, however.]\n[Am I going to get sued? The flipside of protecting your intellectual property is ensuring that you\u0027re not inadvertently infringing somebody else\u0027s. Check that the name of your proposed business has not been trademarked or is in use already for a similar business � if so, find another name. Search the US Patent and Trademark Office database online to see if you are basing your business on an idea that has already been patented, to the best of your ability. What about your proposed website domain name? If someone\u0027s already using it, that could be a problem. At a minimum, do a Google search of what you plan to name your business and make sure nobody\u0027s going to be confused between your business and some other one that\u0027s already out there. That\u0027s a really fast way to get a cease-and-desist letter. Your lawyer can help in these searches, and it\u0027s usually money well spent.]\n[In the field of technology, there\u0027s no realistic way to know for sure that you\u0027re not infringing a patent that some patent troll might come after you over. If you haven�t heard of patent trolls, they are companies that don�t actually build anything, but amass the rights to other peoples� patents for the sole purpose of extorting licensing fees from people who are inadvertently infringing them. Your only real defense here is being too small for the patent trolls to notice. If they know you don\u0027t have enough money for them to extort a meaningful amount from you, they won\u0027t waste their time with you � usually. There are notable exceptions, such as Uniloc\u0027s suit against Laminar Technologies (go look it up.) It\u0027s still worth checking to the best of your ability to make sure you aren\u0027t building your business on top of an idea that\u0027s already been patented. If not, then consider patenting it yourself!]\n[These questions are just the start � we haven\u0027t yet figured out if this business really can sustain an ever-improving lifestyle going forward. To do that, we need a business model.]\n[]\n[]\n[WRITING YOUR BUSINESS PLAN]\n[If you\u0027re seeking investment or a loan, then you\u0027ll be required to have a business plan. Hopefully you are not doing either of those things, but there is still value in having a business plan. It serves as a sanity check that you have some sort of path to success.]\n[You are not going to bet the farm on your business plan, as it is almost certainly going to prove to be wrong. You don\u0027t know how the market will react to your business until you have it in the marketplace, and you can measure that reaction. What you learn can and should cause you to deviate from your original business plan, and find a different, better, path to success. But if you can\u0027t even come up with one path to success in a business plan, then you have a problem. It\u0027s time to go back to the idea generation stage. ]\n[There\u0027s no one specific format for a business plan, but here are the sections from the one I used. Countless books are available just on writing business plans, if you�d like to examine alternative models.  �The Secrets to Writing a Successful Business Plan� by Hal Shelton is one popular example.]\n[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND VISION]\n[This is where you ensure you possess clarity of thought about what you are going to build.]\n[Can you come up with a mission statement for your new company that can fit on a T-shirt?]\n[Your mission can and should be succinct. Here is mine:]\n[Sundog Software\u0027s mission is to power truly immersive outdoor virtual worlds for simulation, training, and entertainment experiences.]\n[Note that my mission is specific, but open-ended enough to allow for future product expansion. You might think a mission statement is just wasteful word-play, but the process of coming up with one forces you to think about what you\u0027re good at, and how you\u0027ll build products that leverage what you\u0027re good at.]\n[Next, describe in a paragraph what you\u0027re going to build, in no uncertain terms.]\n[Look ahead five years, and say what you would like your company to evolve into in that time. What sorts of new products might you extend into?]\n[What are realistic, measurable goals for your business over the next five years? You probably won\u0027t hit all of them, but knowing they are attainable and measurable is what\u0027s important. Are the attainable goals you came up with more than enough to fund the lifestyle you want? If not, you may need to go back and think bigger about your offering or your markets. You may want to write the rest of your business plan, and then revisit these goals, as the rest of the plan may clarify your thinking on what realistic growth looks like for you.]\n[Remember you are writing these goals for your own personal financial planning, and not to convince someone to invest in you or approve your project. It�s important that you are honest and realistic with your goals, and not just trying to convince yourself that your idea is hugely valuable.]\n[DEFINITION OF THE MARKET]\n[Here\u0027s where you\u0027ll get into more detail about your market analysis. Getting this right is even more important than your mission statement. Your market analysis validates that there are enough people willing to give you money in exchange for what you do to pay your bills.]\n[Who is your customer? Describe the type of person or company who needs what you are going to offer. Where do they live? What do they do? What expectations and requirements will they have for what you are offering? How many of them are there?]\n[Don\u0027t estimate your market from the top-down. Saying that some percentage of the US population might buy your product is both lazy and grossly overstated. Understand who your customers are, and count them from the bottom-up. What data can you find about how many of them are really out there? Can you find sales data from other products that cater to the same market? If not sales data, can you estimate sales based on the sizes of the companies that cater to them?]\n[Think creatively about ways to estimate the size and growth of your market. Are there industry reports available that discuss the growth trends of your market? If it\u0027s shrinking, this might not be the best market to invest in! Are there industry organizations that your customers belong to? What are their membership numbers?]\n[Think about the competitive landscape surrounding your market, and how willing your potential customers are to spend money solving the problem your product solves. Of the people who could want your product, how many are likely to actually buy it? What other alternatives do they have today to your product � including the alternative of buying nothing at all? How many have a budget to purchase your item with?]\n[It\u0027s important to do your homework here. If possible, have a friend critique your analysis. Even better, launch your product on the side and start collecting real data!]\n[DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT]\n[This is where you protect yourself against feature creep, at least for your initial product offering. What are you going to offer to your customers?]\n[You want to offer a product that is exciting enough to consumers in order to get a fair measurement of your company\u0027s potential, hopefully before you quit your day job. But, you don\u0027t want to cram so many features into it that you delay your initial launch, or complicate your product unnecessarily. It\u0027s better to launch your initial product, listen to customer feedback, and let that inform future updates to your product. The startup world talks a lot about building a �minimal viable product� (MVP), and that advice applies equally well to your lifestyle business. The book �The Lean Startup� by Eric Ries covers the concept of MVP in much more detail, and is worth reading if you�re new to product management in small businesses.]\n[Describe your product from the point of view of the consumer. What will the feature list on your website look like? What will your press release announcing the product say? What will your advertisements say? This should clarify your thought on the minimum needed to offer an exciting product. Do that, and no more, at first.]\n[What price will you offer your product at? Looking at the prices of similar or competing products is certainly a place to start. If there aren\u0027t any, approach your pricing from a value standpoint. What value will your customer receive from your product, and what is that worth? If you\u0027re having trouble arriving at a price point, I recommend the book \"The 1% Windfall\" by Rafi Mohammed �  it offers precise approaches for determining the optimal price point for a product, and getting that right can make a huge difference in your company\u0027s success.]\n[What is your business model? This can make a huge difference for your cash flow. Will you just offer your product as a one-time transaction, or is there a subscription that gives them access to ongoing support and updates? Will you offer payment plans? Subscription models are popular these days, as it removes the barrier of a large purchase from your customers, but creates an ongoing revenue stream for you that may be more valuable over the long term.]\n[ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT]\n[Even if it\u0027s just you, it\u0027s worth thinking about your corporate structure. You are going to need a lawyer and an accountant, and you may as well find them while you\u0027re still getting a paycheck, as they aren\u0027t cheap. Writing this section of your business plan is going to require some professional advice, but it\u0027s important.]\n[There are complicated issues regarding whether you structure your company as a sole proprietor, a limited-liability company, an S-corporation, or something else. You might even treat your business as one sort of entity for business purposes, and another for tax purposes. All offer different tradeoffs of tax treatment, personal liability, and accounting complexity. That\u0027s just in the US, and it varies from state to state. Talk to your accountant and lawyer to figure out what makes sense in the early stages of your business. I tried to do it all myself at first, and ended up with a huge, unexpected tax bill as a result. Don\u0027t make the same mistake. Even if you\u0027re just testing out your business on the side, any profit you make is still taxable and needs to be dealt with � and by doing commerce with others, you are opening yourself up to liability concerns and things like intellectual property theft.]\n[Go figure it out with a professional, and then write it down in this section of your plan before you forget it all. It\u0027s bound to be complicated. While you\u0027re talking to your lawyer, make sure you understand what\u0027s necessary to obtain the proper licenses and permits for your business as well. In the US, you may require permits at the state, county, and local levels even to run a web-based business out of your extra bedroom.]\n[I don\u0027t know a good way to find reputable accountants and lawyers that specialize in small businesses � maybe that\u0027s another business opportunity in itself! If you have friends who run their own small business, that\u0027s as good a place to start as any. If your local area has a business incubator or economic development office, they may have some professionals they can refer you to as well. Getting to know them is going to be a good idea anyhow.]\n[MARKETING AND SALES STRATEGY]\n[Write down how your customers will discover you.]\n[Ideally, this is largely automated through website search engine optimization (SEO,) landing page optimization (LPO), and targeted online ads. If so, detail what channels you are going to use. If you don\u0027t know what SEO and LPO are, make sure the person who builds your website does.]\n[Is it appropriate to market your products through social media? If so, which networks? What is your strategy for creating content that gets shared and drives traffic to your business? What social networks do your customers frequent? How much time will you dedicate to nurturing your social network presence? Marketing through social media can be effective and low-cost for many businesses, but it requires a large ongoing time commitment. It�s important to think about how to best budget your time on social media marketing, and which social networks might be the most effective for you.]\n[Are there specific websites where your customers congregate? Can you advertise on them? If so, contact them for a rate card and traffic estimates, and figure out how much it might cost to reach new customers through this site. Advertising on websites highly relevant to your business can be a very effective way to attract new customers, if the price is right.]\n[Are there online forums or mailing lists that reach your customers that you can become active on? Like social media, this is a free way to get in front of potential customers, but it comes with a time commitment. Your comments on forums however tend to be longer-lived than social media posts, so often this is an even better use of your time and a more powerful way to increase your site�s ranking on search engines.]\n[Are there physical, targeted mailing lists you can send flyers or postcards to? With so much online and email-based marketing in the world, old-fashioned physical mail is sometimes an overlooked way to get your product in front of people.]\n[Are there publications that cater to your market that you can send press releases to? Sending press releases costs nothing, and can often result in free advertising you�d otherwise spend thousands of dollars for.]\n[Perhaps traditional advertising channels such as magazines, television, radio, or newspapers are relevant for what you do. Don\u0027t rule them out � as your company becomes profitable, this can be a reasonable way to invest back into the business. But tread carefully � the effectiveness of these channels is notoriously hard to measure.]\n[How will you close your sales prospects? Ideally, this too is largely automated �  maybe you collect an email address before giving people an evaluation of your product (or something else of value you can provide at low or no cost), and then they receive automated follow-up messages over time. Maybe the simple act of visiting your website means you start showing more online ads to your prospective customers through what is known as \"remarketing campaigns,\" to prod them into coming back and completing their transaction. Once your customer does decide to make a purchase, doing so should be quick and easy online.]\n[I believe the idea of hiring a salesman to make cold calls, do demos, and harass your potential customers with mind games until they cave in and give you a check is an outdated one. For a business that relies on large, business-to-business transactions in a local area, maybe that still makes sense. But for a global, Internet-based business, your sales should be largely automated. If there is a larger account that requires a personal touch, there is no better salesperson than the founder of the company, which is you.]"
